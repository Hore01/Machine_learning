Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental disorder characterized by a complex array of symptoms, including seeing things,cognitive impairments, hearing voices and disorganized thinking. Accurate prediction of symptom severity on a generalized level is crucial for informing broader treatment approaches and improving overall patient care strategies. This study investigates the comparative effectiveness of single-task learning (STL) and multi-task learning (MTL) in predicting generalized symptom severity among schizophrenia patients using data from the Crosscheck dataset. 
In this study, both single-task and multi-task variants of the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selector Operator (LassoCV and multitaskLassoCV) were employed to predict generalized symptom severity. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was used to evaluate model performance, and the Wilcoxon test was applied to assess statistical significance.
